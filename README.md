# Software-Testing-Automation-QA

### Summary of the project:
This portfolio item includes artifacts from Project One and Two, which are the contact service files (Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, ContactServiceTest.java) and the Project SUmmary and Reflections Report, respectively. The Contact class holds information about new contact objects, and ContactService class uses in-memory data structure to support storing contacts, without user interface. The ContactTest and ContactServiceTest files are JUnit tests used to test the Contact and ContactService classes for verifications. 

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure my code, program, and software are functional and secure by performing various static and dynamic testing. Work products such as the code, project specification documents, user stories, test benches, and contact documents are reviewed to validate that all functional and security requirements are captured in my deliverables. In addition, dynamic testing (such as the JUnit tests demonstrated in this portfolio item) are performed to remove the defects from the deliverables before deployment, which yields robust products.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are identified by performing static testing on work products like the project specifications, user stories, and other contract documents. This also often requires continual collaboration with the end users and other stakeholders to ensure user needs and requirements are fully communicated. 

### How do I approach designing software?
The level of effort in software testing varies from project to project, depending on factors such as the complexity of the software, client/stakeholder involvement, and the level of effort in the software development process. In general, my approach to software testing aligns closely with the software requirements to ensure that all specified functionalities are verified and tested. Having said that, other aspect such as the software security is also considered in my testing approach – i.e., the adherence to the requirement should not compromise the security of the software. As stated in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics, one of the professional responsibilities of a computing professional is to “[d]esign and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure” (ACM Code 2018 Task Force, 2018). Other aspect such as the software performance is also considered in my software testing approach.
